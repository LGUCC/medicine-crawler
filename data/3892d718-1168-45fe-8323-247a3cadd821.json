  "description": "Rabeprazole is used to treat certain stomach and esophagus problems (such as acid reflux, and ulcers). It works by decreasing the amount of acid your stomach makes. It relieves symptoms such as heartburn, difficulty swallowing, and persistent cough. Rabeprazole helps heal acid damage to the stomach and esophagus; helps prevent ulcers, and may help prevent cancer of the esophagus.",
