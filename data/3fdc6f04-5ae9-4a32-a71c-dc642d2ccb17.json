  "description": "Etoricoxib is a COX-2 inhibitor that is used to treat moderate post-surgical dental pain and the painful and inflammatory symptoms of several types of arthritis as a short-term therapy. Etoricoxib acts by inhibiting the cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, which is a natural enzyme. This enzyme aids in the production of other substances in the body known as prostaglandins. Inflammation and pain are caused by prostaglandins, which are created at locations of damage or injury. Because COX-2 enzymes are inhibited by Etoricoxib, lesser prostaglandins are created, reducing inflammation and pain.",
