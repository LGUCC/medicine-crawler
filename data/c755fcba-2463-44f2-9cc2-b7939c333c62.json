  "description": "Candesartan is an antihypertensive medicine that belongs to the class of Angiotensin II receptor blockers. It works by inhibiting the action of certain chemicals that tighten the blood vessels, allowing the heart to pump efficiently and the blood to flow smoothly. Candesartan is used alone and along with other medicines to manage high blood pressure and heart failure. Hypertension is a chronic disease characterized by increased blood pressure. If left untreated, it can lead to complications such as heart failure, heart attack, and kidney failure. Candesartan prevents cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations.",
