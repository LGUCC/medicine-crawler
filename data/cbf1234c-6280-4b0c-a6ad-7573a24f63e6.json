  "description": "Ferric carboxymaltose is an intravenous medicine that acts as an iron replacement and treats iron deficiency anemia (lack of iron in the blood) in patients with chronic kidney disease, who are not dependent on dialysis (CKD) and those who are using iron supplements that aren't working. It acts by replenishing the iron in our red blood cells, which allows oxygen to circulate throughout the body.",
