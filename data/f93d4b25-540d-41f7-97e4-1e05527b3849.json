  "description": "Tiotropium is used to treat lung diseases such as asthma and COPD (bronchitis, emphysema). Tiotropium is used regularly to prevent wheezing and shortness of breath. Tiotropium works by relaxing the muscles around the airways so that they open up and you can breathe more easily. Tiotropium belongs to a class of drugs known as anticholinergics.",
