  "description": "Metformin is an oral anti-hyperglycemic medicine that belongs to the class of Biguanides. It is used to manage diabetes mellitus type II when just lifestyle changes are not enough. Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by abnormally high levels of glucose in your blood. Type II diabetes is the most common form of diabetes where cells become resistant to insulin, leading to increased blood sugar. Metformin increases the bodyâ€™s sensitivity to insulin, decreases the production of glucose, and delays intestinal absorption of glucose.",
