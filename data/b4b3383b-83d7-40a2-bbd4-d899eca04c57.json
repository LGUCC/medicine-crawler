  "description": "Lisinopril is an oral antihypertensive and heart failure medicine that belongs to the class of Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors). It works by dilating the blood vessels to improve blood flow; lowering blood pressure and reducing stress on the heart. Hypertension is a common disease in which the blood pressure in arteries is so high that your heart has to work more than normal. Continuous high blood pressure will eventually cause serious health problems like heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure. Lisinopril improves the chances of survival after a heart attack.",
