  "description": "Tenofovir is an anti-viral prescription medicine that is available in oral and powder forms. It is mostly taken in combination with other medicines to stop the multiplication and growth of a virus inside the body. It is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), which inserts itself into the virusâ€™s DNA to inhibit the viral DNA multiplication. When the virus cannot make its DNA, its number decreases, leading to a favorable prognosis. It is used to treat Hepatitis B, a common cause of liver cancer, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). It also increases white bloods cells count, which ultimately helps fight infections.",
