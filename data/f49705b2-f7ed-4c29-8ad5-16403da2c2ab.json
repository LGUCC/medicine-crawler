  "description": "Favipiravie is an anti-viral prescription medicine that is available in oral form. It may be taken individually or in combination with other medicine to stop the multiplication and growth of a virus inside the body. It inhibits the viral RNA multiplication process. When the virus cannot make its RNA, its number decreases, leading to a favorable prognosis. It is used to treat influenza, Ebola, and COVID-19 (studies under consideration).",
