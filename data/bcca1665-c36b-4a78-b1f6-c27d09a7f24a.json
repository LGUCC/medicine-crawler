Some forms of cancer cells of breast that require estrogen to proliferate can be slowed or stopped by this. Letrozole is a medicine that is used to treat breast cancer. It can also aid in preventing the recurrence of breast cancer. It is mostly used to treat women who have gone through menopause and suffer from \"hormone-dependent\" cancer of breast.",
