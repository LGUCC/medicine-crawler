  "description": "Cefuroxime is a cephalosporin antibiotic, used to treat bacterial infections of the ear, nose, throat, skin, joints, bone, bladder, kidneys and lungs. Cefuroxime also treats sepsis, gonorrhea and the early stages of Lyme disease. To avoid infection, Cefuroxime injection is sometimes also administered before and after surgery. Cefuroxime acts by preventing bacterial growth. It only addresses bacterial infections. It is ineffective against virus infection (such as flu, common cold).",
