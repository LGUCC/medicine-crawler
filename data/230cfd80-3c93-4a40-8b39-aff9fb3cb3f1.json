  "description": "Rocuronium is used to relax the muscles. It works by blocking the signals between your nerves and your muscles. Rocuronium is given before general anesthesia in preparing you for surgery. This medicine helps to keep your body still during surgery. It also relaxes your throat so a breathing tube can be more easily inserted before the surgery.",
