  "description": "Amlodipine is approved by the FDA in 1987, is a popular antihypertensive drug belonging to the group of drugs called dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Due to their selectivity for the peripheral blood vessels, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers lower the incidence of myocardial depression and cardiac conduction abnormalities than other calcium channel blockers.Amlodipine is commonly used in the treatment of high blood pressure and angina. Amlodipine has antioxidant properties and an ability to enhance the production of nitric oxide (NO), an important vasodilator that decreases blood pressure . The option for single daily dosing of amlodipine is an amazing feature of this drug.",
