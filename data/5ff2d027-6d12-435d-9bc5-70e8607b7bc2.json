  "description": "Diltiazem is an antianginal and antihypertensive medicine that belongs to the class of calcium channel blockers. It works by relaxing the blood vessels to allow easy flow of blood and reduced heart rate. Hypertension is a common disease in which the blood pressure in arteries is so high that your heart has to work more than normal. Continuous high blood pressure will eventually cause serious health problems like heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure. Diltiazem along with treating mild to moderate hypertension also treats and prevents angina (chest pain).",
