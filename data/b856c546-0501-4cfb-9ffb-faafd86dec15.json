  "description": "Atenolol is an antihypertensive medicine that belongs to the class of beta-blockers. It works by blocking the action of certain chemicals that helps to reduce the workload and heart rate. Atenolol is used alone or in combination with other medicines to manage high blood pressure, chest pain (angina), and acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality. Hypertension is a common disease in which the blood pressure in arteries is so high that your heart has to work more than normal. Continuous high blood pressure will eventually cause serious health problems like heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure.",
