  "description": "Paroxetine is a medicine used to treat depression, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic attacks, and post-traumatic disorders. It works by restoring the balance of a natural substance in the brain, serotonin. It inhibits serotoninâ€™s uptake in the brain (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor-SSRI). It improves appetite, mood, sleep, and energy levels. It may also reduce the frequency of unpleasant thoughts and improve the overall quality of life.",
