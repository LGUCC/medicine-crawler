  "description": "Dexibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicine used to treat moderate to extreme pain, such as menstrual cramps, toothache, and osteoarthritis. Dexibuprofen acts by preventing the action of naturally occurring chemicals in the body known as cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzymes. These enzymes aid in the production of other compounds in the body known as prostaglandins. By inhibiting the action of COX enzymes, lesser prostaglandins are generated, hence reducing inflammation and pain.",
