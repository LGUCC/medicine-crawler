  "description": "Itopride is a dopamine type 2 receptor antagonist with acetylcholinesterase inhibiting characteristics that helps patients suffering from functional dyspepsia speed up stomach emptying. This medicine is typically used to treat GI symptoms induced by decreased GI motility, including non-ulcer/dysmotility dyspepsia, gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying), abdominal bloating, regurgitation, heart burn, anorexia, vomiting, and nausea, as well as other gastric, dopamine or prolactin related diseases.",
