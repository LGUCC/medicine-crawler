  "description": "Acyclovir is an antiviral medicine. It treats infections caused by the herpes virus including cold sores, and genital herpes. Acyclovir decreases the severity and length of these outbreaks. It helps the sores heal faster, keeps new sores from forming, and decreases pain/itching. In addition, in people with a weakened immune system, acyclovir can decrease the risk of the virus spreading to other parts of the body and causing serious infections.",
