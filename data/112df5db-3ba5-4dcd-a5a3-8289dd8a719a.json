  "description": "The tetanus vaccine is included in the recommended childhood and adult vaccination schedule. It defends against tetanus, often referred to as lockjaw, a bacterial infection. The tetanus vaccination is created by inactivating the tetanus toxin with a chemical. The inactivated toxin is known as a \"toxoid.\" The tetanus toxoid stimulates an immunological reaction to the toxin after injection, but it does not cause disease (tetanus), like the toxin does.",
