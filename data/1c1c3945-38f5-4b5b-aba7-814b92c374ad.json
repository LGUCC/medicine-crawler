  "description": "Vaccinations against Streptococcus pneumoniae are called pneumococcal vaccines. They can help prevent pneumonia (an infection of lungs that causes the air sacs in your lungs to become inflamed and get clogged with pus or fluid), sepsis (severe response of body to a bacterial infection), and meningitis (inflammation of the brain and spinal cord's protective membranes)in some cases. They are administered by injection into a muscle or just beneath the skin. Chemicals derived from Streptococcus pneumonia bacteria are used in this pneumococcal vaccination. Our bodies perceive these compounds as foreign after receiving pneumococcal vaccine and develop antibodies to kill them.",
