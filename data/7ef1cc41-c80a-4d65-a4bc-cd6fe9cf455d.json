  "description": "Citalopram is an effective antidepressant medicine that is used to treat depression (feelings of grief, loss, or rage) and panic disorders (sudden feeling of intense fear or discomfort). Citalopram functions by boosting the amounts of a chemical in our brain called serotonin. As a result, it enhances mood, decreases anxiety, and reduces the occurrence of panic attacks. It belongs to SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) class of medicines.",
