  "description": "Letrozole belongs to a class of drugs known as nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors. It works by lowering the amount of estrogen the body produces. Some forms of cancer cells of breast that require estrogen to proliferate can be slowed or stopped by this. Letrozole is a medicine that is used to treat breast cancer. It can also aid in preventing the recurrence of breast cancer. It is mostly used to treat women who have gone through menopause and suffer from \"hormone-dependent\" cancer of breast.",
