  "description": "Gliclazide is an oral anti-hyperglycemic medicine that belongs to the class of sulfonylureas. It is used to manage diabetes mellitus type II when just lifestyle changes are not enough. Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by abnormally high levels of glucose in your blood. Type II diabetes is the most common form of diabetes where cells become resistant to insulin, leading to increased blood sugar. Gliclazide promotes insulin secretion from the beta cells of pancreas and improves its dynamics.",
