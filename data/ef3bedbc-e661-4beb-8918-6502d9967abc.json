Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by abnormally high levels of glucose in your blood. Type II diabetes is the most common form of diabetes where cells become resistant to insulin, leading to increased blood sugar. Sitagliptin increases the production of insulin and decreases the production of glucose.",
