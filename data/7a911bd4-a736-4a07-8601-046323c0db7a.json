  "description": "Sitagliptin is an oral anti-hyperglycemic medicine that belongs to the class of DPP-4 inhibitors. It is used to manage type II diabetes mellitus in adjunct to lifestyle changes. Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by abnormally high levels of glucose in your blood. Type II diabetes is the most common form of diabetes where cells become resistant to insulin, leading to increased blood sugar. Sitagliptin increases the production of insulin and decreases the production of glucose.",
