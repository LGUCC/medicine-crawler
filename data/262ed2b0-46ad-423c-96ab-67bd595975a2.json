  "description": "Glucosamine is a naturally occurring substance in the body. Glucosamine Sulphate is a Glucosamine supplement. The body uses Glucosamine to create other compounds that help to develop cartilage, ligaments, tendons and the fluid surrounding joints. The cartilage and fluid that surrounds joints provide cushioning. Taking Glucosamine may assist to enhance cartilage and fluid surrounding joints, and/or prevent joint deterioration. Glucosamine Sulphate is frequently taken in people having osteoarthritis. Glucosamine is also prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis, joint pain, multiple sclerosis, and a variety of other diseases.",
