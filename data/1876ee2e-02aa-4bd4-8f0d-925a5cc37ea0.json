  "description": "Solifenacin succinate belongs to a group of medicines known as antispasmodics. It is used to treat an overactive bladder (a condition in which the bladder muscles contract uncontrollably and cause frequent urination). It works by relaxing the muscles of the urinary bladder. This reduces the frequency and urgency of urination.",
