  "description": "Piroxicam-beta-cyclodextrin is a combination of the NSAID Piroxicam and an inactive cyclic macromolecule called beta-cyclodextrin. The Piroxicam -cyclodextrin complex is tolerated in the upper Gastrointestinal tract better than free Piroxicam, whilst retaining all of the parent compound's anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Furthermore, the medicine has a rapid rate of absorption, which results into a speedier onset of analgesic efficacy, an effect that has been proven in multiple clinical tests.",
