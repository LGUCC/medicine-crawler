  "description": "Epoetin alfa is used to treat anemia in people with long-term serious kidney disease. Epoetin alfa may also be used in anemic patients to reduce the need for blood transfusions before certain planned surgeries that have a high risk of blood loss. Epoetin alfa works by signaling the bone marrow to make more red blood cells. Epoetin alfa is very similar to the natural substance in your body that prevents anemia.",
