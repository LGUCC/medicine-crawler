  "description": "Febuxostat belongs to the class of xanthine oxidase inhibitor. It works by inhibiting the enzyme xanthine oxidase and decreases the serum uric acid levels in the body which is responsible for causing gout (very painful form of arthritis that is caused due to uric acid deposition in the form of crystals in the big toe or other joints). It shows effective treatment results in gout characterized by severe pain, tenderness in joints, and redness. However, it should only be used if you have gout symptoms due to high uric acid in the blood.",
