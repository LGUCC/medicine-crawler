  "description": "Fosfomycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is used for treating urinary tract infections that aren't too aggressive. It acts by disrupting the synthesis of the cell wall of bacteria, which stops the bacteria from growing. This antibiotic is solely used to treat infections caused by bacteria. It is ineffective against viral infections (such as flu and common cold).",
