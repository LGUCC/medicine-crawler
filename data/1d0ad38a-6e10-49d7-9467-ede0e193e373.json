  "description": "Formoterol is a long-acting bronchodilator used as a long-term (maintenance) treatment to prevent or decrease wheezing and trouble breathing caused by asthma or ongoing lung disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-COPD, which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema). Formoterol works by relaxing the muscles around the airways so that they open up and allow breathing more easily.",
