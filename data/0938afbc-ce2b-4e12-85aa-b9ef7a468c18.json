  "description": "Progesterone belongs to a group of medicines known as progestins. It is used as a part of hormone replacement therapy in women. Progesterone works by decreasing the amount of estrogen in the uterus thereby, decreasing the risk of developing uterine cancer. Progesterone prevents abnormal thickening of the lining of uterus in post-menopausal women. When given to women of child-bearing age, it induces menstruation by replacing the natural progesterone that some women are missing.",
