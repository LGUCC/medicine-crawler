  "description": "Secukinumab is an interleukin inhibitor that is used to treat moderate to extreme plaque psoriasis (a skin condition characterized by scaly, red lesions on some body regions) in adults when systemic therapy is indicated. In adults, it also treats acute  psoriatic arthritis and acute ankylosing spondylitis (an inflammatory illness that causes a few of  the spinal bones to fuse). The injection belongs to a class of medicines known as monoclonal antibodies. It acts by blocking the action of specific cells in the human body that induce psoriasis symptoms.",
