  "description": "Furosemide is a medicine used to reduce excessive fluid retention (edema) in the body. It belongs to the class of Diuretics; also known as water pill. It works by increasing the excretion of excess salt and water, producing more urine and lowering blood pressure. Hypertension is a common disease in which the blood pressure in arteries is so high that your heart has to work more than normal. Continuous high blood pressure will eventually cause serious health problems like heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure. Furosemide is beneficial for both adults and children to reduce edema due to various health conditions.",
