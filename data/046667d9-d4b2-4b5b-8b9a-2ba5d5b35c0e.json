This medicine is typically used to treat GI symptoms induced by decreased GI motility, including non-ulcer/dysmotility dyspepsia, gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying), abdominal bloating, regurgitation, heart burn, anorexia, vomiting, and nausea, as well as other gastric, dopamine or prolactin related diseases.",
