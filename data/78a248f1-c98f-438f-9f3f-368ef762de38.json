  "description": "Glimepiride medicine is used, in combination with an appropriate diet and exercise, for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (a condition characterized by elevated sugar levels) that is inadequately controlled by metformin alone or metformin and other antidiabetic medicines. It does not treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis. Its prescribed and consistent use helps maintain normal blood sugar levels, prevents organ damage, and lowers the probability of heart, kidney, and brain disease.",
